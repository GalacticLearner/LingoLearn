A blessing in disguise
A dime a dozen
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Bite the bullet
Break the ice
Call it a day
Cut somebody some slack
Cutting corners
Easy does it
Get out of hand
Get something out of your system
Get your act together
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Hang in there
Hit the sack
It's not rocket science
Let someone off the hook
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
On the ball
Pull someone's leg
Pull yourself together
So far so good
Speak of the devil
That's the last straw
The best of both worlds
Time flies when you're having fun
To get bent out of shape
To make matters worse
Under the weather
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wrap your head around something
You can say that again
Your guess is as good as mine
A perfect storm
Barking up the wrong tree
Break a leg
By the skin of your teeth
Comparing apples to oranges
Costs an arm and a leg
Do something at the drop of a hat
Don't cry over spilt milk
Every cloud has a silver lining
Get a taste of your own medicine
Give someone the cold shoulder
Go on a wild goose chase
Good things come to those who wait
He has bigger fish to fry
He's a chip off the old block
Hit the nail on the head
Ignorance is bliss
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Leave no stone unturned
Let the cat out of the bag
Make a mountain out of a molehill
On thin ice
Play devil's advocate
Rain on someone's parade
Sit on the fence
Steal someone's thunder
Take it with a grain of salt
The ball is in your court
The best thing since sliced bread
The elephant in the room
The whole nine yards
Throw caution to the wind
You can't judge a book by its cover
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A penny for your thoughts
Actions speak louder than words
Add insult to injury
All bark and no bite
Back to the drawing board
Barking up the wrong tree
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice
Burn the midnight oil
Can't judge a book by its cover
Curiosity killed the cat
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Drive someone up the wall
Easier said than done
Every dog has its day
Get a second wind
Get your ducks in a row
Go down in flames
Have your head in the clouds
Hit the sack
In the heat of the moment
It takes two to tango
Jump the gun
Leave no stone unturned
Let the cat out of the bag
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
No pain, no gain
Not playing with a full deck
Off one's rocker
On the ball
Once in a blue moon
Piece of cake
Pull someone's leg
Pull yourself together
Raining cats and dogs
Saving for a rainy day
See eye to eye
Sit on the fence
Speak of the devil
Steal someone's thunder
Take it with a grain of salt
The best thing since sliced bread
The early bird catches the worm
The elephant in the room
The whole nine yards
Through thick and thin
Throw in the towel
Under the weather
Weâ€™ll cross that bridge when we come to it
Wrap your head around something
Your guess is as good as mine
A little learning is a dangerous thing
Actions speak louder than words
Add fuel to the fire
All in the same boat
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An arm and a leg
At the drop of a hat
Back to square one
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Better late than never
Between a rock and a hard place
Bite off more than you can chew
Break the ice
Burn the midnight oil
By the skin of your teeth
Close but no cigar
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Cut corners
Cut the mustard
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilled milk
Don't give up your day job
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Drastic times call for drastic measures
Elvis has left the building
Every dog has its day
Get a taste of your own medicine
Give someone the benefit of the doubt
Go back to the drawing board
Good things come to those who wait
Heard it through the grapevine
He's not playing with a full deck
Hit the books
In the heat of the moment
It takes two to tango
Jump on the bandwagon
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the cat out of the bag
Make a long story short
Miss the boat
Not the sharpest tool in the shed
Off one's rocker
On the ball
